# PlatformOcean: Server Side Plug-in Architecture

This repository contains the code for a plug-in PlatformOcean server. It was developed as part of a final year project.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on the machine to run the server. [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) must be installed (for Windows as a Windows service) for the MongoDB plug-in to run.

To run the code open a terminal in the local repository and run:

- npm install
- node presentation.js

The code has only been tested to run on Windows.
